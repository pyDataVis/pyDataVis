Test of the PRF option in the Convert menu.

PRF file are generated by the FullProf software (https://www.ill.eu/sites/fullprof/index.html) at the end of a Rietveld analysis of powder diffraction data. 

There are two examples, each in its folder. These folders contain the XRD pattern used for Rietveld analysis (.dat) and the input file used by Fullprof (.pcr). Here we will use the .prf file.

Select one folder and open the .prf file; for example in "Anatase" folder open "Anatase.prf".

The data are not decoded, select the PRF option in the Convert menu.

This generate a new file using the same name as the ".prf" file but with ".plt extension. Then this file is loaded and plotted in a new pyDataVis window. The .png image file shows the Plotting area.
