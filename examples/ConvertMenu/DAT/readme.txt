Test of the option "DAT" in the convert menu.

- Open the file "urea.dat" which contains a neutron diffraction pattern of urea with ".dat" diffraction file format. The file is not automatically decoded.
- Select the option "DAT" in the convert menu. This create a new file using the same name as the ".dat" file but with ".plt" extension (in this case "urea.plt"). Then this file is loaded and plotted in a new *pyDataVis* window.
