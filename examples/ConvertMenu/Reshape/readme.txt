Test for "Reshape" option in Convert menu.

The Reshape option allows to change the shape of a data block (number of lines and columns) while keeping the total number of elements constant. In this example, Reshape will transform 1D data in 2D.

Open the file "Reshape.txt". It contains only one vector with 20 elements.

Select the "Reshape" option in Convert menu.

In the popup window, choose 2 for the number of columns.

This create a new file using the same name as the initial ".txt" file but with ".plt" extension (in this case "Reshape.plt"). This file is loaded in a new *pyDataVis* window. It contains two vectors with 10 elements.
