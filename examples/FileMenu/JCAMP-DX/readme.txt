Reading spectroscopic data stored in JCAMP-DX format (http://www.jcamp-dx.org/protocols.html).

There are four files in this folder, two MS spectra and two IR spectra.

They can be loaded in pyDataVis with the "Open" option in the File menu or by dragging the file, from the file manager in the pyDataVis window.
