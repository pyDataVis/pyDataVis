Test for "lineq" script command.

This command computes the equation of the line linking the marker positions on a curve. 

To test the "lineq" command, open the file "lineq.plt".

Use the data cursor (left mouse click) and two markers (Ctrl+M) to select two points on the curve Y=f(X).

Then enter the command "lineq Y" in the script window and execute (Ctrl+E).

This open an information window giving the slope and the intercept of the line linking the points defined by the intersection of the markers with the curve Y=f(X) (see lineq.png image).
