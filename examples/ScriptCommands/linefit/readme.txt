Test for "linfit" script command.

Compute the equation of the line fitting the curve Y at the cursor position. The last parameter, which must be either -1 or +1, indicates the direction of the fitting line. 

To test the "linefit" command, open the file "linefit.plt".

Place the data cursor (mouse left click) on the left side of the peak

Then enter "linefit Y 1" in the Script window and execute (Ctrl+E).

A dashed red line is drawn and an information window is open giving the slope and the intercept of this line (see linefit.png image).
