Test for "onset" script command.

This command is used to determine the onset of a peak. Before using the onset command, both markers must be positioned to indicate the beginning and the approximate place of the inflection point at the base of the peak.

To test the "onset" command, open the file "onset.plt".

Use the data cursor (left mouse click) and two markers (Ctrl+M) to select on the left side of the peak, a first point on the baseline and a second point near the base.

Then enter "onset Y" in the Script window and execute (Ctrl+E).

Two dashed red lines are drawn and an information window is open giving the coordinates of the intersection of the lines (see onset.png image). The onset of the peak is the xi value.
