Test for "line" script command.

This command joins, by a straight line, the points of a curve situated 
at the marker positions. We will use it to delete the second peak.

Open the file "line.plt".

Use the data cursor (left mouse click) and two markers (Ctrl+M) to select
two points on each side of the second peak.

Enter "line Y" in script window and execute.

You should obtain something like the line.png image.
