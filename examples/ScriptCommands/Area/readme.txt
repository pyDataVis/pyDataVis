Test for "area" script command.

This command computes the area under a curve Y=f(X) using the trapezoidal rule. The limits of the integration must be indicated by the marker positions. 

To test the area command, open the file "area.plt".

Use the data cursor (left mouse click) and two markers (Ctrl+M) to select a region,

Then enter the command "area Y" in the script window and execute (Ctrl+E).

This open an information window giving the area. As mentioned the area is defined by the curve Y=f(X) and the x-axis. Thus a baseline correction may be required before the area calculation.
