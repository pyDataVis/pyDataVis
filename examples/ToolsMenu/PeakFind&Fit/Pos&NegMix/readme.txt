Test for "Peak Fitting" option in "Tools' menu.

Open the file "Hf.plt".

Select the "Peak Fitting" option in "Tools' menu.

A dialog pops up where you can input the peak parameters, which are the peak type, the position, the height and the peak width. You can use as initial guess:
AG, 229, 0.05, 1.0
AG, 231,-0.03, 0.5
Click OK to launch the fitting process. You should get something like the image peakFit.png.

Clicking on OK generates the file “peakFit.txt” and opens a new pyDataVis window to display its content.
