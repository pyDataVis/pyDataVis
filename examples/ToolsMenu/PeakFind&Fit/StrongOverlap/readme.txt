Test for "Peak Fitting" option in "Tools' menu.

Open the file "dTG.plt".

Select the "Peak Fitting" option in "Tools' menu.

A dialog pops up where you can input the peak parameters, which are the peak type, the position, the height and the peak width. You can use as initial guess:
G, 100, 0.1, 50
G, 200, 0.05, 50
G, 400, 0.01, 50
Click OK to launch the fitting process.

Clicking on OK generates the file “peakFit.txt” and opens a new pyDataVis window to display its content (see peakFit.png).
