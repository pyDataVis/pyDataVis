Test for "Smoothing" option in the Tools menu.

Open the file "Smoothing.plt".

Select the "Smoothing" option in the Tools menu.

This open the interactive tool. The computation was done initially with the Savitzky-Golay algorithm with a Filter size = 5, the polynomial order = 3 and the number of pass = 1.

Try to increase the Filter size and the Number of pass to improve the smoothing effect.

Compare the Savitzky-Golay with the Moving average algorithm.

When you click on "OK" the original data is replaced by the blue curve, the Smoothing window is closed and the Plotting area is updated.
