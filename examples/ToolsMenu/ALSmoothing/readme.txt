Test for "ALS Smoothing" option in the Tools menu.

As its name does not suggest this tool is primarily used for baseline correction.

Open the file ALS-Smooth.plt

Select the "ALS Smoothing" option in the Tools menu.

This open the interactive tool. 
The computation was done initially with lambda = 100000.0 and p = 0.01.

With these parameters the baseline curve does not fit very well the data curve.
Try to decrease p to improve the fitting.

A good trade-off seems p = 0.001 as shown on the image ALS-Smooth.png.

When you click on "OK" the original data is replaced by the blue curve, the window is closed and the Plotting area is updated.
