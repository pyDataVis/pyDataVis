Test for "Curve Fitting" option in the Tools menu.

There are three folders, showing three examples, each with a different fitting model:
- Arrhenius
- RheoModel
- Sigmoid

Let us look in the Sigmoid folder:

Open the file "Sigmoid.plt"

Select the "Curve Fitting" option in the Tools menu.

This open a new window for the curve and the model selection. For the curve you have no choice since there is only one. Select "Sigmoid" as Fitting model and click OK.

This open the interactive tool window. pyDataVis try to guess the initial parameter values from an analysis of the data. Then the fitting process is started. When an optimum is find the results are displayed.

Try to change the parameter values using the fields at the bottom of the window.

When you click on "OK" the original data is replaced by the blue curve, the window is closed and the Plotting area is updated.
