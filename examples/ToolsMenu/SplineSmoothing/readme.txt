Test for "Spine Smoothing" option in the Tools menu.

Open the file "SplSmoothing.plt"

Select the "Spine Smoothing" option in the Tools menu.

This open the interactive tool. The computation was done initially with the Smoothing factor = 1.0

Try to increase this value to improve the smoothing effect. A good trade-off seems a value of 5 like shown in the picture SplSmoothing.png.

Try also to change the degree of spline.

When you click on "OK" the original data is replaced by the blue curve, the window is closed and the Plotting area is updated.
