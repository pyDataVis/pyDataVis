# pyDataVis

**pyDataVis** is an open source application for interactive visualization, analysis and manipulation of scientific data. There are many [free plotting software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Free_plotting_software) most of them far more powerful than *pyDataVis*. However, in terms of simplicity, it is hard to beat. Indeed it is designed to be very easy to use, just drag and drop your data file in *pyDataVis* window and immediately you are seeing the curves. For now, *pyDataVis* is limited to 2D plotting.

*pyDataVis* is written in [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)) and use [PyQt](https://riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/) as graphic user interface (GUI) and [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) for plotting.


# Installation

pyDataVis requires Python 3, PyQt5, Numpy, Pandas, Scipy and Matplotlib. The easiest way to install everything is to use Open Source [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) that will "just work" out of the box for Windows, macOS and common Linux platforms.

Then open a Terminal and change the current working directory to the location where you want to copy the pyDataVis folder, for example ~/myprog:
```
cd ~/myprog
```
Then type:
```
git clone https://github.com/pyDataVis/pyDataVis.git
```


## Usage

Change the current working directory to the pyDataVis folder:
```
cd ~/myprog/pyDataVis
```
and execute the pyDataVis.py script:
```
python pyDataVis.py
```
